# üìä The Flex Reviews

A full-stack application for managing, moderating, and displaying guest reviews from multiple booking sources.
Built with **Next.js 15, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Supabase), React Query, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui**.

> **Note**: This project was developed as part of the **Flex assessment**. The provided Hostaway sandbox API contained no usable data, so mock data was used for seeding. However, the production code is structured to integrate directly with the real API if available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations

* Demo data is seeded for presentation only.
